                        <h6>Why does the organization process personal data?</h6>
                        <p>The organization needs to process data to enter into an employment contract with you and to meet its obligations to you. For example, it needs to process your data to establish you as an employee, to pay you in accordance with your employment contract and to administer benefit, pension and insurance entitlements.</p>
                        <p>In some cases, the organization needs to process data to ensure that it is complying with its legal obligations as listed above. For example, it is required to check an employee’s entitlement to work in the UK, to deduct tax, to comply with health and safety laws and to enable employees to take periods of leave to which they are entitled.</p>
                        <p>If you fail to provide personal data, we may not be able to perform the employment contract or meet our legal obligations.</p>
                        <p>In other cases, the organization has a legitimate interest in processing personal data before, during and after the end of the employment relationship or other type of contractual relationship with you as an independent contractor (self-employed). Processing such personal data allows the organization to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><i class="fa fa-check"></i>run recruitment and promotion processes,</li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>The organization may also need to process data from job applicants, current or former employees or independent contractors in order to respond to and defend against legal claims.</p>
                        <h6>Sensitive/Special Category data</h6>
                        <p>As explained above, the organization also processes some special categories of personal data, such as information about health or medical conditions, to carry out employment law obligations such as those in relation to employees with disabilities.</p>
                        <p>Where the organization processes other special categories of personal data, such as information about ethnic origin, sexual orientation or religion or belief, this is done for the purposes of equal opportunities monitoring. Data that the organization uses for these purposes is anonymised or is collected with the express consent of employees, which can be withdrawn at any time.</p>
                        <h6>Who has access to data?</h6>
                        <p>Your information may be shared internally for the purposes of the recruitment exercise. This includes members of the HR and recruitment team, interviewers involved in the recruitment process, managers in the business area with a vacancy and IT staff if access to the data is necessary for the performance of their roles.</p>
                        <p>The organization will not share your data with third parties, unless your application for employment is successful and it makes you an offer of employment. The organization will then share your data with our clients to ensure your suitability, start date and safety on site.</p>
                        <p>Your information may be shared internally, including with members of the HR and recruitment team including payroll, your line manager, managers in the business area in which you work and IT staff if access to the data is necessary for performance of their roles.</p>
                        <p>With regard to successful job applications the organization shares your data with third parties in order to obtain pre-employment references from other employers, obtain employment background checks from third-party providers and obtain necessary criminal records checks from the Disclosure and Barring Service. In any other applicable case the organization may also share your data with third parties in the context of a sale of some or all of its business. In those circumstances the data will be subject to confidentiality arrangements.</p>
                        <p>We will only collect information about criminal convictions if it is appropriate given the nature of the role and where we are legally able to do so. We will keep you informed of this retention and will request your consent in advance.</p>
                        <p>The organization also shares your data with third parties that process data on its behalf, in connection with payroll, the provision of benefits and the provision of occupational health services.</p>
                        <p>The organization will not transfer your data to countries outside the European Economic Area.</p>
                        <h6>How does the organization protect data?</h6>
                        <p>The organization takes the security of your data seriously. The organization has internal policies and controls in place to try to ensure that your data is not lost, accidentally destroyed, misused or disclosed, and is not accessed except by its employees in the performance of their duties.</p>
                        <p>Where the organization engages third parties to process personal data on its behalf, they do so on the basis of written instructions, are under a duty of confidentiality and are obliged to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure the security of data.</p>
                        <h6>For how long does the organization keep data?</h6>
                        <p>If you are a job applicant and your application for employment is unsuccessful, the organization will hold your data on file for 6 months after the end of the relevant recruitment process. At the end of that period your data is deleted or destroyed.</p>
                        <p>If your application for employment is successful, personal data gathered during the recruitment process will be transferred to your personal file and retained during your employment. The periods for which your data will be held will be provided to you in a new privacy notice.</p>
                        <p>If you are an employee or an independent contractor the organization will hold your personal data for the duration of your employment. The periods for which your data is held after the end of employment are in line with the companies’ retention policy.</p>
                        <h6>Your rights</h6>
                        <p>As a data subject, you have a number of rights. You can:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><i class="fa fa-check"></i>access and obtain a copy of your data on request,</li>
                            <li><i class="fa fa-check"></i>require the organization to change incorrect or incomplete data,</li>
                            <li><i class="fa fa-check"></i>require the organization to delete or stop processing your data, for example where the data is no longer necessary for the purposes of processing, and</li>
                            <li><i class="fa fa-check"></i>object to the processing of your data,</li>
                            <li><i class="fa fa-check"></i>request the restriction of processing of your personal data, which will result in a suspension of processing whilst it is reviewed,</li>
                            <li><i class="fa fa-check"></i>request the transfer of your data to a third party.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>If you would like to exercise any of these rights, please contact our management body. If you believe that the organization has not complied with your data protection rights, you can complain to the Information Commissioner.</p>
                        <h6>What if you do not provide personal data?</h6>
                        <p>If you are a job applicant or an independent contractor you are under no statutory or contractual obligation to provide data to the organization during the recruitment process. However, if you do not provide the information, the organization may not be able to process your application properly, may not process your application at all or may not enter into contractual agreement with you if you are an independent contractor.</p>
                        <p>As an employee you have some obligations under your employment contract to provide the organization with data. In particular, you are required to report absences from work and may be required to provide information about disciplinary or other matters. You may also have to provide the organization with data in order to exercise your statutory rights, such as in relation to statutory leave entitlements. Failing to provide the data may mean that you are unable to exercise your statutory rights.</p>
                        <p>Certain information, such as contact details, your right to work in the UK and payment details, have to be provided to enable the organization to enter a contract of employment with you. If you do not provide other information, this will hinder the organization’s ability to administer the rights and obligations arising as a result of the employment relationship efficiently.</p>
